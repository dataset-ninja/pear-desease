**DiaMOS Plant Dataset: A Dataset for Diagnosis and Monitoring Plant Disease** is a dataset for instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the agricultural research. 

The dataset consists of 3386 images with 3589 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *leaf* and *pear*.

Images in the DiaMOS Plant Dataset dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *fruits* (380 images) and *leaves* (3006 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the [University of Cagliari, Italy](https://www.unica.it/unica/en/homepage.page).

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 2 classes:
