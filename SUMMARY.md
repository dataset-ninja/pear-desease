**DiaMOS Plant Desease** (DiaMOS Plant Dataset for Diagnosis and Monitoring Plant Disease) is a dataset for instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the agriculture industry.

The dataset consists of 3386 images with 3589 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *leaf* and *pear*.

Each image in the DiaMOS Plant Desease dataset has pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *fruits* (380 images) and *leaves* (3006 images). The dataset was released in 2021.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 2 classes:
